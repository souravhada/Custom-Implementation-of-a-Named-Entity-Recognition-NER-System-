# Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system from scratch using Python. The aim is to build an understanding of the fundamental algorithms used in NER by manually implementing them, instead of relying on high-level NLP libraries. This approach helps in gaining a deeper insight into the workings of text processing and entity recognition techniques.

## Objectives
- **To implement basic text processing functions** such as tokenization, cleaning, and preprocessing of text data.
- **To develop and understand foundational NLP algorithms** suitable for NER, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) or Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
- **To engage in feature engineering** by manually creating features that help in the identification of named entities.
- **To build and train the NER model** on a standard dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **To develop a simple application** that demonstrates the functionality of the custom NER system.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Basic Python libraries: `numpy` for numerical operations

## Current Progress
- [x] Data collection and initial preprocessing
- [ ] Implementation of text processing functions
- [ ] Algorithm development for NER
- [ ] Feature engineering
- [ ] Model training and evaluation
- [ ] Application development for demonstrating the NER system

## Upcoming Updates
- Implementation details on the NER algorithms being developed.
- Updates on the training progress and initial results.
- Interface development for real-time entity recognition.
